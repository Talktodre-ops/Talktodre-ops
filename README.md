## 🎯 Who I Am

**4 years** of experience building **production-ready ML systems** that solve real business problems. I specialize in taking AI/ML projects from concept to deployment, with a track record of systems running in production for **universities, e-commerce platforms, and real estate companies**.

**Background**: Computer Science + Mathematics (B.Sc., Obafemi Awolowo University)

**What sets me apart**: I don't just build models—I build **end-to-end systems** with measurable impact. From fraud detection pipelines processing **10K+ listings/day** to AI detection tools serving **500+ students**, I focus on production-ready solutions.
